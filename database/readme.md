# Database Preprocessing

Considering that the data is organized in .csv files, a brief preprocessing was necessary.

To generate the database that will be used by the API, you need to have Python 3 installed. You can find it available at the following link: [Python 3 Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

First, you need to create a virtual environment. To do this, execute the following command:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
```

Afterward, activate it with the following command:
For Windows:

```shell
venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

For Linux:

```shell
source venv/bin/activate
```

With the virtual environment activated, install the project's dependencies with the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Navigate to the 'src' folder using the following command:

```shell
cd src/
```

Execute the Python script using:

```shell
python3 preprocessing_database.py
```

The database will be generated within the API's folder for it to consume.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3 - for data manipulation tools.
- Jupyter Notebook - for code construction and readability.
- MovieLens Dataset - the dataset defined by the company.
- Pandas - used for dataset manipulation.
- SQLite - the database that stores the tables generated by the script.

## Considerations

To facilitate data manipulation by the API and the Client, data preprocessing was performed. In the end, all the necessary data is contained in a single table with the columns: movieId, year, title, rating, amount_ratings, and genre.
